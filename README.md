# Tableau-for-SAT-Test-Results


Overview:

A static dashboard offers all the information required, but users are unable to modify their presentations. Therefore, interactive dashboards are required. With our dashboard user have that accessibility to the dashboard, based on user needs and required information, user can change the dashboard. This will give the only required information in a easy manner for every user. By using the tableau features like filters, top N filters, analytics, reference lines, parameters, calculated fields, live database connections, thresholds etc are helpful to create an interactive dashboard. These features will help the users to get a better understanding and representation of the data. We used these features for this visualization to filter out counties, districts, schools with respect to the scores and finding the maximum values/scores, minimum values/scores, average scores/values by adding the reference lines to the visualizations by setting the ranges.
